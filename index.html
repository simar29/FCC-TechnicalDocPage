                <p>Python is a high-level, interpreted, interactive and object-oriented scripting language.Python is designed to be highly readable. It uses English keywords frequently where as other languages use punctuation, and it has fewer syntactical constructions than otherlanguages.</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Python is Interpreted </b>− Python is processed at runtime by the interpreter. You do not need to compile your program before executing it. This is similar to PERL and PHP.</li>
                    <li><b>Python is Interactive</b> − You can actually sit at a Python prompt and interact with the interpreter directly to write your programs.</li>
                    <li><b>Python is Object-Oriented </b>− Python supports Object-Oriented style or technique of programming that encapsulates code within objects.</li>
                    <li><b>Python is a Beginner's Language</b> − Python is a great language for the beginner-level programmers and supports the development of a wide range of applications from simple text processing to WWW browsers to games.</li>

                <p>Python was developed by Guido van Rossum in the late eighties and early nineties at the National Research Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science in the Netherlands.</p>
                    <p>Python is derived from many other languages, including ABC, Modula-3, C, C++, Algol-68, SmallTalk, and Unix shell and other scripting languages.</p>
                    <p>Python is copyrighted. Like Perl, Python source code is now available under the GNU General Public License (GPL).</p>
                    <p>Python is now maintained by a core development team at the institute, although Guido van Rossum still holds a vital role in directing its progress.</p>

                <header><h2>Python Features</h2></header>
                <p>Python's features include −
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Easy-to-learn</b>− Python has few keywords, simple structure, and a clearly defined syntax. This allows the student to pick up the language quickly.</li>
                        <li><b>Easy-to-read</b>− Python code is more clearly defined and visible to the eyes.</li>
                        <li><b>Easy-to-maintain</b> − Python's source code is fairly easy-to-maintain.</li>
                        <li><b>A broad standard library</b> − Python's bulk of the library is very portable and cross-platform compatible on UNIX, Windows, and Macintosh.</li>
                        <li><b>Interactive Mode</b>− Python has support for an interactive mode which allows interactive testing and debugging of snippets of code.</li>
                        <li><b>Portable</b> − Python can run on a wide variety of hardware platforms and has the same interface on all platforms.</li>
                        <li><b>Extendable</b> − You can add low-level modules to the Python interpreter. These modules enable programmers to add to or customize their tools to be more efficient.</li>
                        <li><b>Databases</b> − Python provides interfaces to all major commercial databases.</li>
                        <li><b>GUI Programming</b>− Python supports GUI applications that can be created and ported to many system calls, libraries and windows systems, such as Windows MFC, Macintosh, and the X Window system of Unix.</li>
                        <li><b>Scalable</b>− Python provides a better structure and support for large programs than shell scripting.</li>

                <h3>Environment Setup</h3>
                <p>Python is available on a wide variety of platforms including Linux and Mac OS X. Let's understand how to set up our Python environment.</p>

                <h3>Local Environment Setup</h3>
                <p>Open a terminal window and type "python" to find out if it is already installed and which version is installed.

                <h3>Getting Python</h3>
                <p>The most up-to-date and current source code, binaries, documentation, news, etc., is available on the official website of Python https://www.python.org/</p>
                <p>You can download Python documentation from https://www.python.org/doc/. The documentation is available in HTML, PDF, and PostScript formats.</p>
                
                <h3>Installing Python</h3>
                <p>Python distribution is available for a wide variety of platforms. You need to download only the binary code applicable for your platform and install Python.</p>
                <p>If the binary code for your platform is not available, you need a C compiler to compile the source code manually. Compiling the source code offers more flexibility in terms of choice of features that you require in your installation.</p>

            <section class="main-section" id="basic_syntax">
                <header><h2>Basic Syntax</h2></header>
                <p>The Python language has many similarities to Perl, C, and Java. However, there are some definite differences between the languages.</p>

                <h3>First Python Program</h3>
                <p>Let us execute programs in different modes of programming.</p>

                    <h4>Interactive Mode Programming</h4>
                    <p>Invoking the interpreter without passing a script file as a parameter brings up the following prompt −</p>
           
                    <p>
                        <code>
                            <pre>
                                $ python
                                            Python 2.4.3(#1, Nov 11 2010, 13:34:43)
                            </pre>
                        </code>
                       
                    </p>

                    <p>Type the following text at the Python prompt and press the Enter −</p>
                    <p ><code>>>> print "Hello, Python!"</code></p>
                    <p>If you are running new version of Python, then you would need to use print statement with parenthesis as in print ("Hello, Python!");. However in Python version 2.4.3, this produces the following result −</p>
                    <p ><code>Hello, Python!</code></p>

                    <h4>Script Mode Programming</h4>
                    <p>Invoking the interpreter with a script parameter begins execution of the script and continues until the script is finished. When the script is finished, the interpreter is no longer active.</p>
                    <p>Let us write a simple Python program in a script. Python files have extension .py. Type the following source code in a test.py file −</p>

                    <p><code>print "Hello, Python!"</code></p>
                    <p>We assume that you have Python interpreter set in PATH variable. Now, try to run this program as follows −</p>
                    <p ><code>$ python test.py</code></p>
                    <p>This produces the following result −</p>
                   
                    <p><code>Hello, Python!</code></p>
                                     
                    <p>Let us try another way to execute a Python script. Here is the modified test.py file −</p>
                    <p><code><pre>#!/usr/bin/python

                        print "Hello, Python!"</pre></code></p>
                    <p>We assume that you have Python interpreter available in /usr/bin directory. Now, try to run this program as follows −</p>
                    <p><code><pre>$ chmod +x test.py     # This is to make file executable
                        $./test.py</pre></code></p>
                    <p>This produces the following result −</p>
                    <code>Hello, Python!</code>
